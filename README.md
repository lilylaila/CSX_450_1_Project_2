# CSX_450_1_Project_2


+ DOMAIN

 The problem is drawn from the analysis of wholesale customer data set.
 
 + PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
 Given the wholesale data on 400 client, we wish to explore between channel and spending on milk products using cluster analysis in order to design promotions.

 
 + DATASET AND INPUTS
 
 The dataset to be examined is the wholesale customers which consists of 440 customers memberships and 8 variables (FRESH,MILK, GROCERY, FROGEN, DETERGENTS_PAPERS, DELICATESSEN, REGION, CHANNEL).
 
 + SOLUTION STATEMANT
 
 A solution to this problem will be a cluster analysis using a model such as KMeans clustering or a Hierachical      clustering,
 
  
 + INSIGHTS: 
 More milk spending occurred in channel 2 (retail), but channel 1(hotel/restaurant/cafe) has more clients. 
 Channel 2 (retail) also has higher average spending ($10,716 vs $3,452) than channel 1 (hotel/restaurant/cafe)

+ BENCHMARK MODEL
  N/A unsupervised model
  
 + Evaluation Metrics
 
 Given that this is a clustering task, we can measure the success of our model using the silhouette score.
